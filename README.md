# Elm of life

...game of elm? game elm life? I can't come up with a witty name...

This is Conway's game of life, written in Elm. Bootstrapped with Create Elm App, I will be using minimal external packages. 

The purpose of this little project's existence is to get myself re-acquainted with Elm, and introduce myself to CSS grid. 

I'll host it somewhere when it's done I guess.
